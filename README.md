# CS-320

CS 320 emcompasses Software Test Automation. The main focus of this class was to ensure a working knowledge for unit testing, specifically using JUnit test cases. A unit test is the ability to test the smallest fragments of code possible, usually individual methods and functions. Ensuring each method functions correctly, and then integrating that into a larger scale of code helps to ensure software functionality and security. Regression testing ensures each added method doesn't break the current code, and integration testing ensures each method can work with one another.
To help interpret user needs, we can use the software development lifecycle to plan and evaluate those needs, and then develop and test them as we incorporate them into the program. This is how I approach software design, keeping the overall user's needs in mind as I plan, develop, and test, each method and function.
